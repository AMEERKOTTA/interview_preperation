As a data scientist, your roadmap typically involves acquiring a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, programming, and machine learning, while also developing domain knowledge and problem-solving skills. Here is a comprehensive roadmap to guide you in your journey as a data scientist:

1. Mathematics and Statistics:
   - Linear algebra: Learn concepts like matrices, vectors, and matrix operations.
   - Calculus: Understand differential and integral calculus for optimization algorithms.
   - Probability theory: Master concepts like probability distributions, random variables, and hypothesis testing.
   - Statistics: Learn descriptive and inferential statistics, sampling techniques, and regression analysis.

2. Programming:
   - Python: Gain proficiency in Python, a popular programming language for data science. Learn libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
   - R: Familiarize yourself with R, another widely used language for statistical computing and graphics.
   - SQL: Understand how to work with relational databases using SQL for data retrieval and manipulation.

3. Machine Learning:
   - Supervised learning: Learn algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
   - Unsupervised learning: Understand clustering algorithms (k-means, hierarchical clustering) and dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE).
   - Deep learning: Explore neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
   - Model evaluation and validation: Learn techniques to assess model performance, including cross-validation, precision-recall, ROC curves, and evaluation metrics.
   - Ensemble methods: Familiarize yourself with techniques like random forests, gradient boosting, and bagging.

4. Data Manipulation and Visualization:
   - Data cleaning: Understand techniques for handling missing data, outliers, and data imputation.
   - Data wrangling: Learn how to transform and reshape data using tools like pandas and dplyr.
   - Data visualization: Develop skills in creating meaningful visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and ggplot2.

5. Big Data and Cloud Computing:
   - Apache Hadoop: Learn the basics of Hadoop and the Hadoop ecosystem, including MapReduce and HDFS.
   - Apache Spark: Familiarize yourself with Spark for distributed computing and processing large datasets.
   - Cloud platforms: Gain experience working with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalable data processing and storage.

6. Domain Knowledge and Communication:
   - Gain expertise in a specific domain or industry (e.g., finance, healthcare) to understand the unique challenges and requirements of that field.
   - Develop strong communication and storytelling skills to effectively communicate findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

7. Continuous Learning:
   - Stay up to date with the latest trends and advancements in data science through online courses, books, research papers, and attending conferences.
   - Participate in Kaggle competitions or other data science challenges to apply your skills and learn from others.

Remember that this roadmap is a general guideline, and you can adjust it based on your specific interests and career goals. Additionally, hands-on experience and real-world projects will be crucial in solidifying your skills and building a strong portfolio. Good luck on your data science journey!
